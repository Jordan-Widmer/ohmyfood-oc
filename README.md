# OhMyFood

This is the third project in the OpenClassrooms Web Developer training program. The objective is to integrate advanced CSS effects, implement a navigation structure using the Sass preprocessor, and ensure visual coherence at all levels of responsiveness. The project is to create Ohmyfood!, an online food ordering service that enables users to pre-compose their meals from 4 Parisian restaurants and save time by avoiding the hassle of menu consultation.

## Deliverables

Content of pages: Create the homepage and 4 Parisian restaurant detail pages.

Graphical effects and animations:
Buttons: On hover, the background color of the main buttons should slightly lighten. The shadow should also be more visible. Eventually, visitors will be able to save their favorite menus by clicking a heart-shaped "like" button, which should gradually fill up. For this first version, the effect can appear on hover on desktop instead of click.

Home page: When the application has more menus, a loading spinner will be necessary. On this model, we want to have a preview of it. It should appear for 1 to 3 seconds when arriving on the homepage, cover the entire screen, and use CSS animations (no library). The design of this loader is not defined, any proposal is welcome as long as it is consistent with the site's graphic charter.

Menu pages: Upon arrival on the page, the dishes should appear progressively with a slight time lag. They can either appear one by one or by group "Starter," "Main course," and "Dessert." An example of the expected effect is provided. The visitor can add the dishes they want to their order by clicking on them. This will make a small checkmark appear to the right of the dish. This checkmark should slide from right to left. For this first version, the effect can appear on hover on desktop instead of click. If the title of the dish is too long, it should be truncated with ellipsis.

## Technical constraints

The development must be done in CSS, without JavaScript. No framework should be used, but the use of SASS is a plus. No CSS code should be applied via a style attribute in an HTML tag. The code should use semantic tags and must not contain any errors or warnings in the W3C HTML and CSS validator. The entire site must be responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop. The site must be perfectly compatible with the latest desktop versions of Chrome and Firefox.
